# Project: Data Warehouse
---

## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

## Resources
**Datasets**
- Song Dataset: contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song

    ```
    num_songs:1
    artist_id:"ARD7TVE1187B99BFB1"
    artist_latitude:null
    artist_longitude:null
    artist_location:"California - LA"
    artist_name:"Casual"
    song_id:"SOMZWCG12A8C13C480"
    title:"I Didn't Mean To"
    duration:218.93179
    year:0
    ```
    
    
- Log Dataset: consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the song dataset

    ```
    {"artist":null,
    "auth":"Logged In",
    "firstName":"Walter",
    "gender":"M",
    "itemInSession":0,
    "lastName":"Frye",
    "length":null,
    "level":"free",
    "location":"San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA",
    "method":"GET",
    "page":"Home",
    "registration":1540919166796.0,
    "sessionId":38,
    "song":null,
    "status":200,
    "ts":1541105830796,
    "userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"",
    "userId":"39"}
    ```


**Tables (a star schema)**
- **Fact Table**
1. songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
- **Dimension Tables**
2. users - users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. songs - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. artists - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
5. time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project files
- create_table.py : create  fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift
- etl.py : load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into your analytics tables on Redshift
- sql_queries.py : define SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above.
- dwh.cfg : contains connection information

## ETL pipeline
1. Load song and log data both from S3 buckets.
2. Stage the loaded data.
3. Transform the data into the above described data schema.

### Example codes
#### CREATE

    ```
    song_table_create = ("""
    CREATE TABLE song 
    (
        song_id   VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
        title     VARCHAR NOT NULL,
        artist_id VARCHAR,
        year      INTEGER,
        duration  DECIMAL NOT NULL
    )
    """)
    ```

#### INSERT

    ```
    song_table_insert = ("""
    insert into song(
        song_id,
        title,
        artist_id,
        year,
        duration
    )
    select
        ss.song_id,
        ss.title,
        ss.artist_id,
        case when ss.year != 0 then ss.year else null end as year,
        ss.duration
    from staging_songs ss
    """)
    ```
